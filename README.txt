Code for simulation of the transverse field Ising model.
Simulation uses zero temperature projector quantum Monte Carlo and is designed for calculating the Renyi entropy.

This code was used for the results in this publication: http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.1069

The main code is here, but some submission and analysis scripts are not currently included.
